Python Games Collection
Welcome to the Python Games Collection repository! This project is a compilation of classic games implemented using the Pygame library. The collection includes:

Tetris: The timeless block-stacking puzzle game where you must fit falling tetrominoes together to clear lines and score points.
Snake: The classic arcade game where you control a growing snake, aiming to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or yourself.
Checkers: The traditional strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid, where you aim to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them from making a move.
